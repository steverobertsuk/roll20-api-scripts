# LazyExperience — Testing Guide

## Automated tests

```bash
npm run build -- --no-bump
npm test
```

`tests/lazyexperience.test.mjs` covers:

- commands and aliases
- the split (absent share, bonus, extra shares, remainder)
- payout modes, undo and the Roll20 party
- defeats (bar, linked attribute, marker, TokenMod, DeathTracker, prompt and automatic modes)
- level-ups and milestones
- the D&D 2024 and 2014 sheets, sandbox 1.0, migration from 0.1.14, settings, One-Click options, escaping and every card

`tests/systems.test.mjs` covers each game-system profile.

The tests run against a stubbed Roll20 API. Beacon sheets are faked, so check the live list below in a real game before release.

## Test game

**Mod Test Lab - LazyExperience** (22183309) is a copy of Mod Test Lab: Jumpgate, Mod sandbox v1.5, D&D Fifth Edition (2024) sheet. It has four 2024 PCs, one of them (Seraphina) controlled by Test Player, and 2024 monsters (Goblin Warrior, Ogre, Lich and others). TokenMod is installed. The build is installed as the Mod script "LazyExperience v1 Test".

The tests were driven with the playwright-tests harness on copied browser profiles (GM and Test Player).

## Sheet tests — 5 November 2026, Jumpgate, sandbox v1.5

Game: **Mod Test Lab - Sheets** (22183801), a new empty Jumpgate game with LazyExperience and a probe Mod. For each sheet, the game's Character Sheet Template was switched in Game Settings and the sandbox restarted. Then:

1. A PC (ticked as Party Member) and a creature with a token were made.
2. Their fields were filled in through the sheet's own inputs, so the sheet saved them as if a player had typed them.
3. LazyExperience ran `add` and `end`. The saved attributes were read back.
4. The creature's HP bar was set to 0 from the GM's client.

The option values in the Game Settings sheet list are the sheet names Mods see (`ogl5e`, `pathfinderneceros`, …). The profiles use them.

### Found while testing sheets, and fixed

- The D&D 5E (Classic) sheet's `sanitizeXP` worker calls `.trim()` on the XP. LazyExperience wrote a number, so the worker crashed and the sheet never saw the change. Legacy sheets are now written with text, as a player would type it.
- The guessed sheet names were wrong for most sheets (for example `5eshaped` instead of `dnd5eshaped2`), and a loose name pattern took `pathfinderneceros` for Pathfinder 1E. Profiles now use the exact names from the Game Settings list. Copies are recognised by their attributes.
- Pathfinder and Starfinder only store `xp_max` when it differs from the sheet's default. A blank value gave no level-up notice, so Pathfinder now falls back to the medium track and Starfinder to its own table. A sheet's next-level value, when there is one, always comes first.
- A character on a system without XP (Savage Worlds and others) was listed in the session summary as paid. It isn't any more.

### Sheet facts

- Characters made by a Mod with `createObj` report a blank `_charactersheetname`, so the game's sheet (`Campaign().sheetName`) is used.
- The sandbox only learns the game's new sheet after it restarts.
- After the game was switched to `pathfinder2eofficial`, saving Game Settings with another sheet (Cosmere, WFRP) left it on Pathfinder 2e.

## Translations

The 23 translations were written by Claude (Google Translate refused the sync with HTTP 429) and checked by script against en-US: same keys and list lengths, every `{placeholder}` and command kept, and no characters that would break a Roll20 query. The few strings still identical to English are words that are the same in that language (Session, Version, Menu, Status) or names kept on purpose (Mod sandbox). They have not been proofread by native speakers.

## Found live and fixed

- The Party card's three buttons wrapped beside each name in the narrow chat panel. They now sit on a line under the name.
- Game-system labels with commas would split the settings card's Roll20 query options. They're now cleaned.

## Platform facts found while testing

- `setSheetItem(id, 'experience', 0)` is ignored by the 2024 sheet, so a Mod can't take a 2024 character back to 0 XP. LazyExperience warns instead.
- `setComputed` didn't change `experience`.
- `npc_xp` on the 2024 sheet can be text ("33000 or 41000 in lair") or "---" on PCs.
- The computed `npc` flag is 0 even for monsters. LazyExperience goes by who controls the character instead.

## Not yet tested live

- Cosmere RPG (Roll20 would not switch the test game to it), and Pathfinder Community and Starfinder level-up notices with the fallback tables (added after their runs; covered by tests).
- WFRP 4E totals: the ledger row is added, but the sheet did not recalculate `total_xp` and `current_xp`.
- Sheets in a game that has used them for a while (the tests used new characters).
- DeathTracker 1.0's `onStatusChange` (DeathTracker 1.0 is still being written).
- Upgrading a live game that has 0.1.14 state (covered by tests only).
- Mod sandbox v1.0 with the 2024 sheet (covered by tests only).
- Legacy (non-Jumpgate) engine.
- One-Click install options.

## Manual checklist for a sheet

1. Make a game with the sheet, two PCs controlled by players and one monster.
2. `!lazyxp status`: the expected game system is listed.
3. `!lazyxp add 100`, `!lazyxp end`: each PC's XP field goes up by 50.
4. Drop the monster's HP bar to 0: the prompt shows its XP (or asks for an amount).
5. Give enough XP to pass a level: one notice per character.
