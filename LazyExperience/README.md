# LazyExperience

LazyExperience collects the experience points (XP) a party earns during a session, splits them fairly and writes them to the character sheets. It works with the D&D 2024 sheet and many other sheets.

- **Many sheets, tested in Roll20.** D&D 5E 2024 (Beacon), D&D 5E Classic and Shaped, Pathfinder 1E, Community and 2E, Starfinder, Old School Essentials, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Dungeon World, Shadowrun 5E and 6E (karma) and Cypher. WFRP 4E is partly supported. Other sheets work through common field names, or fields you name yourself. See **Supported sheets**.
- **Roll20's own party.** Characters ticked as **Party Member** share the XP. Without a party, the characters controlled by players do.
- **Defeated creatures.** A creature dropping to 0 HP, getting the defeated marker, or being marked dead by DeathTracker adds its XP to the session. By default you're asked first. The XP comes from the sheet's XP value or challenge rating.
- **Fair splits.** Absent players can get nothing or part of a share, and characters can have their own share. There's bonus XP for one character and extra shares for companions. XP that doesn't divide evenly carries over to the next session.
- **Two ways to pay.** XP can be paid at the end of the session (the default) or straight away.
- **Level-ups** are announced when a character has enough XP.
- **Session Log handout.** Every session is recorded, newest first.
- Help and Command Deck handouts, in 24 languages.

## Quick start

1. Install LazyExperience. A **LazyExperience - Help** and a **LazyExperience - Command Deck** handout appear in the journal.
2. In Jumpgate, tick **Party Member** on each player character (open the character, then its settings). You can also select their tokens and use **Add Selected to Party** on the Party card. Without a party, every character controlled by a player shares the XP.
3. Type `!lazyxp` to open the menu.
4. When a creature's HP bar reaches 0, you are asked whether to add its XP. You can also select defeated tokens and press **Defeated: Selected**.
5. Use **Add XP** for anything else (quests, role-play), and **Bonus: Selected** for one character.
6. Mark players who missed the session as **Absent**.
7. Press **End Session**. Each character's XP is written to their sheet, announced, whispered to its player and added to the **LazyExperience - Session Log** handout.

## Commands

Every command starts with `!lazyxp`. `!lazyexperience` also works, and so does `!xp` unless EasyExperience or ExperienceTracker is installed (both use it). Only the GM can use the commands. Other Mods, such as ScriptCards, can send them too.

Commands for characters use the selected tokens, or `--ids` followed by character or token IDs separated by commas.

## Supported sheets

LazyExperience picks a game-system profile for each character from the sheet the game uses. That is the **Character Sheet Template** in the game's Settings. Every sheet below was tested in a Jumpgate game on 5 November 2026. Each test filled in a PC and a creature through the sheet itself, then:

- paid XP with **End Session**;
- checked the value saved on the sheet and that the sheet's own calculations ran;
- dropped the creature's HP to 0;
- checked for the level-up notice.

| Sheet in Roll20's settings                          | Sheet name (Mods)        | XP written to                                                      | Level-up notice from                              | Defeated creature's XP                       | Result                                                  |

Notes:

- Sheets that aren't listed but are copies of a listed one are recognised by attributes only that sheet has.
- Characters made by another Mod (not in the journal) report no sheet name, so the game's sheet is used.
- Legacy sheets get XP as text through the sheet's own workers, as if a player had typed it.
- Beacon sheets (D&D 2024) need **Mod sandbox v1.5**, and a Mod can't set them to 0 XP.
- Sheets offered through Demiplane (`nexus_…`), such as Daggerheart and Starfinder 2e, keep their data outside Roll20's attributes. They aren't supported.

## Upgrading from 0.1

Settings, session XP and each character's extra XP are brought across the first time 1.0 starts. Players or characters that weren't active are left out of the party. A custom command name keeps working, and so do the old subcommands: `add session <xp>`, `add <characterid> <xp>`, `end`, `resetxp`, `config`, `refresh`.

## For other Mods

`LazyExperience.addToPool(xp, reason)`, `award(character, xp, reason)`, `give(character, xp)`, `recordKill(token, xp?)`, `confirmKill(tokenId, xp?)`, `getSession()`, `getSystem(character)`, `onAward(fn)` and `onLevelUp(fn)`.
